  <h2>What goes in Mee Goreng?</h2>
    <p>Here’s what you need to make Mee Goreng. Feel free to switch around the protein and vegetables – just follow the quantities in the recipe so you don’t dilute the flavour!</p>
    <p>The key ingredient in the signature sticky noodle sauce is <strong>Kecap Manis</strong> which is a <em>syrupy sweet soy sauce</em> that adds both flavour and sweetness into the sauce as well as thickening it.</p>
    <p>Nowadays you’ll find it in the Asian section of large supermarkets in Australia, such as Woolworths and Coles.</p>
    <p>In both Indonesia and Malaysia, Mee Goreng is made with all sorts of noodles. Thick, thin, crinkly, smooth.</p>
    <p>What might surprise you though is that Mie Goreng is actually commonly made by street vendors using <em>instant noodles</em>! Literally, the noodles you get in ramen and other instant noodles packets (just toss the seasoning packet).</p>
    
    <p>I like using instant noodles for Mie Goreng because you get that signature crinkly look just like you get from street food vendors!</p>
